## What I am
I am a [Hugo](//gohugo.io) website, with two themes. [Universal](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) provides the base layer of theming, with a custom [useR](https://github.com/lockedata/hugo-user-theme/) theme which overides some areas of Universal. The folder `themes/[theme]/layout/partials/` contain all the `.html` needed for the website pages, with the exception of the Markdown, which is saved in `/content/`.

## How to set me up on GitLab

This part will be done for you by a member of the RFCC.

### Create a new repository

1. Log on to the R-conferences GitLab.

2. Create a new repository for the year the site will be for. E.g. https://gitlab.com/R-conferences/user[YEAR].git

### Set the repo as a mirror of the main repository

1. In a terminal with access to git, navigate to a directory where you will clone the repository.

2. Create a bare clone of the repository.

    ```
    git clone --bare https://github.com/lockedata/user_hugo_template
    ```

3. Mirror-push to the new repository.
    
    ```
    cd user_hugo_template.git
    git push --mirror https://gitlab.com/R-conferences/user[YEAR].git
    ```
    Note, if you get the error 
    
    ```
    remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
    ```
    
    you may need to run the following command first
    
    ```
    git config --system --unset credential.helper
    ```
    
    (if using the Windows command prompt you will need to be running as Administrator).

4. Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.

    ```
    cd ..
    rm -rf user_hugo_template.git
    ```
    
### Deploy to Netlify

1. Login to Netlify via R-conferences GitLab account.
2. Click "New site from Git".
3. Select GitLab as the git provider.
4. Select the repository created in the previous steps.
5. Use the build command `hugo`.
6. Use the publish directory `public`    .

## How to set me up locally

This part should be done by anyone maintaining the website.

### Clone the new repository

1. Clone the new repository set up at https://gitlab.com/R-conferences/user[YEAR].git.

### Initialise the submodules

If you want to run the site locally to view when you're making changes, you need to initialise the submodules

1. Open a terminal with access to git.
2. Navigate to the new repo.
3. Initialise and fetch the submodules.
    ```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

### Customise the config

The file [config.toml](https://github.com/lockedata/user_hugo_template/blob/master/config.toml) gives you access to a number of points on the site, mostly using [site params](https://gohugo.io/variables/site/#the-site-params-variable).

A high level overview of these features:

* `enable` 
    + boolean to render or hide that section
* `title`/`subtitle`/`description`/`button text`/...
    + strings to display text in that position
* `bg`
    + boolean to toggle lightly shaded backgrounds on or off for that section
* `photo1`/`photo2`
    + toggle between `background-image-fixed-1`/`background-image-fixed-2` as a background, which are located in `static/img/`
### Bios

The team bios are constructed from the `[[params.programming.members]]` and `[[params.organising.members]]`. Most of these fields are optional and can be deleted to prevent them rendering in the site. 

The icons can be changed per person with [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The headshots are held in `static/img/organising` and `static/img/programming`. The 'faceholder' is in `/themes/hugo-user-theme/static/img/[organising and programming]`, but you should place yours in the root `/static/img/[organising and programming]`, which will mask/override the blanks.

### Sponsors

Sponsor images should be held in `static/img/sponsors`. The files in `/data/sponsors/` control the how and what sponsor image is displayed, and it's location in a folder `tier1`, `tier2`, and `tier3` control where it is on the page.

### Important Dates

Is sourced from a csv stored in `/csv`.

### Content pages

Markdown files are located in `/content`. The News/blog is driven from `/content/blog`, and the other pages in the navbar are driven from the files in `/content/`. An example of how subpages could be constructed is [located in this commit](https://github.com/lockedata/user_hugo_template/commit/211168db3cb975292fd1b8e399669b4c3b24cce0) where the shared 'parent' of 2 `content.md` are specified in the config.

## What if I need even more customistation?

In the hopefully rare event that even more specific material is needed you can explore the following. Make use of the [hugo inheritance method](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/#hugo-layouts-lookup-rules-with-theme) to override defaults where applicable, rather than modify the defaults in place.

### CSS/style

* Copy the base `hugo-user-theme/static/css/styledefault.css` into `/static/css/style.css` in your root
  + This will now be the style sheet for your website, overriding the themes
  
### New Section/Custom Section

* Either 
  + find a [partial](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/) from `/layouts/partials` in the existing themes you want to base your work on, copy it to the project `/layouts/partials`, and modify the copy
  + write a new `myfile.html` from scratch and include it in the project `/layouts/partials`
* then make sure that it is referenced in `index.html`

### Deployment

The website created for you by the RFCC will be automatically updated when you push your changes to the master branch.
